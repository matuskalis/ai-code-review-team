The useEffect hook is missing a dependency array, causing the fetch calls to run on every render. Additionally, filtering posts after fetching them can be inefficient, especially if the number of posts is large. The component also uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML, which can pose security risks if the bio content is not sanitized."},{"agent_type":"style","status":"completed","issues":[{"severity":"high","line_number":8,"issue":"Missing dependency array in useEffect.

The use of `useEffect` without a dependency array can lead to infinite loops, and the lack of error handling in API calls can cause silent failures. Additionally, there are style violations such as inconsistent naming conventions and missing documentation. These issues can significantly impact the maintainability of the code, especially for a team working on the project in the future."}],"overall_summary":"**Code Review Partially Complete** | Grade: **C** (78.4/100)\n8 unique issues identified from 2/3 agents.\n\n⚠️ **Warning**: 1 agent(s) failed: Security\n\n⚠️  **3 High** priority issues found.\n📋 **3 Medium** priority improvements suggested.\n💡 **2 Low** priority suggestions.\n\n**Agent Results:**\n- ✗ **Security**: Agent failed: All models failed.
